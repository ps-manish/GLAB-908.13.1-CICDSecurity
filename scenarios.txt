# Set of scenarios where security risks could occur in the CI/CD process

Third-party library vulnerability

Developers add a new third-party library to the codebase without reviewing its security vulnerabilities
The library contains a critical security flaw, which the developer is unaware of
The library is deployed to the production environment through the CI/CD pipeline
Potential consequences: attackers could exploit the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system, execute arbitrary code, or steal sensitive data

Exposed sensitive information
A DevOps engineer mistakenly exposes an API key or a password while configuring a service account
The sensitive information gets committed to the source code repository
The code is deployed to the production environment through the CI/CD pipeline
Potential consequences: attackers could use the exposed information to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data

Malicious code injection
A developer commits code to the source code repository that contains a backdoor or a malicious code snippet
The code gets deployed to the production environment through the CI/CD pipeline
The backdoor remains undetected for a long time
Potential consequences: attackers could gain unauthorized access to the system, steal sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code

Source code repository compromise
An attacker successfully injects a malicious code snippet into the source code repository through a phishing attack or a social engineering tactic
The code gets deployed to the production environment through the CI/CD pipeline
The attacker gains access to sensitive data or takes control of the system
Potential consequences: attackers could steal sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, or cause disruption to the system

Missed security vulnerability
A QA engineer misses a critical security vulnerability while testing the code
The vulnerability goes unnoticed until the code is deployed to the production environment through the CI/CD pipeline
The vulnerability could allow attackers to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code
Potential consequences: attackers could gain unauthorized access to the system, steal sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code
